 -> What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
    * I would like to add logger with the server environment for debuging app , 
    * I would like to do server side caching using Redis to boost server performance,
    * I would like to add more test cases ,

-> What's your favourite programming language? Why?
   * My favorite programming language is a JavaScript.
   * Because ,i like the JS prototype inheritense , array functions , promises , async ,await , closures , high order function throught this you can write very power full code, With JS you can build anything: dynamic web pages, web apps, web servers (Node.js), browser extensions, services, desktop apps (electron), mobile apps (Ionic), games (WebGL), IoT etc.It is available on every device with a browser or can easily be made available with a single node.exe. and it's very easy to learn , 

-> How would you track down a performance bottleneck in an application? Have you ever had to do this?
    * the backend performance causes becuase of database queries , So fine-tune those database queries and maximize performance,
    * try to send only required data to front end avoid extra response data,

    * I never had performance issue on production server , because of the less users .


-> How would you deploy your API in a production environment?
   * set the server envirnment to production ,
   * i always prefer database server as different machine,
   * open only the backend server ip and port for the database server ,
   * and install the production dependencies only,
   * and start the server

-> Please describe yourself using either XML or JSON.
    * I always prefere JSON ,
    * because transfering data from server to client or cliet to server take less time for json and moe time for ( XML because of size ) 
    * and it's very easy to handle JSON programatically
